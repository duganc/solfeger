## Installation

At the moment, this isn't being served anywhere so the best option is to clone the repo and run a local web server.  This can be done using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository using the `Clone or Download` button in Github or the command line
1. Navigate to the repository's root directory in the terminal.
1. Run python's simple `http.server` using `python3 -m http.server`.  If it doesn't run, you may need to [install it first](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#Running_a_simple_local_HTTP_server).
1. Navigate to the appropriate port on `localhost` (`8000` by default) in your browser.  e.g. `localhost:8000`.
1. The page should load and you should see a login page.
